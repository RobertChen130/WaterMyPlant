# WaterMyPlant
I always want to build something that can water my plant automatically, cause I don't like water them at all.
## WaterPlant_A
WaterPlant_A is the first result of the project, it is working well.
## WaterPlant_B
These days, I am learning OOP programing. So I am planing to do this project again use OOP programing.
